   :Description:
      Cart is a small but powerful extension which "solely" adds a shopping cart to your TYPO3 installation.
      CartPdf allows you to generate attractive PDFs. Whether order confirmations, invoices, delivery notes,
      or even your own types. The EventListener integrates itself into the ordering process so that the
      generated files are sent as email attachments.
