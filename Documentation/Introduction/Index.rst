Introduction
============

EXT:cart_products needs to be used together with :t3ext:`cart`.

EXT:cart itself is only the base for a webshop.

Only using EXT:cart does not allow to sell anything because there are no products.

Therefore EXT:cart needs other extensions. One of those other extensions is EXT:cart_products.
